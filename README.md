# ISBN App 

assenment:
We want to make a new phone book web app. We need to have a form that allows us to enter users data which should include 
* first name 
* last name 
* street address
* city
* state 
* zip 
* phone number 
>This data should be stored in your aws database. We then want to return all entries and also be able to update an entry. We could also have a search field where the user can search by name or number. We want this app deployed to heroku
 


## To try this App out.
* you need to gem install sinatra
* clone this repo
* run ruby app.rb

This is [on heroku](https://phonebook-app88.herokuapp.com/).
